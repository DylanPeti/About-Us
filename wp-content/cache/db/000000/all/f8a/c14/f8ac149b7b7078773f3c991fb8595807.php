<p>â€œContent is king.â€ Youâ€™ve no doubt heard this expression and let it guide your web development strategy, but the truth is, creating content is really just the tip of the iceberg. And if youâ€™re churning out content that doesnâ€™t adhere to SEO best practices, you might be wasting your time. Like every other aspect of your business, content development should be part of a strategy. Sage Island has seen many content development trends come and go in our 17-year history, and we know what gets results for todayâ€™s web developers.</p>
<p>There are lots of SEO tricks to keep in mind as you develop your copy, which weâ€™ll get to in a moment, but all of it is secondary to the first rule of copywriting: <em>write genuinely good copy</em>. How well optimized your content is wonâ€™t matter if it doesnâ€™t engage readers. As you write your copy, consider your businessâ€™s unique goals. Are you trying to sell something, be informative, or get people through the doors of you business? Your content should be well written and genuinely interesting to the audience you want. Not only will you be helping your potential customers find the information theyâ€™re looking for, but youâ€™re also building brand trust with those customers and increasing the likelihood that they will share your content on social media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be smart. Be savvy. Be funny. And if you arenâ€™t any of those things, hire a copywriter who is.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chances are, you want your siteâ€™s content to reach the most relevant audience to increase qualified traffic. So before you sit down to write, your company will need to perform keyword research to figure out how your customers are searching and what your competition is up to. When it comes to your business, you donâ€™t want to blindly guess what your audience responds to. Good keyword research gives you insight into the mind of your potential customers; it allows you to see what kind of language they are using to ask questions, which gives you the opportunity to provide easy-to-find solutions.Â </p>
<p>So, what should you do with keyword research once you have it? Use it wisely. Knowing top-ranking keywords doesnâ€™t give you permission to write like a robot. Include top keywords in your contentâ€™s title, but make sure the title is relevant to your content and sounds natural. Keep your title under 55 characters (or 512 pixels) to appear correctly in search engine results. You should also sprinkle keywords throughout your body copy, making sure that your content is still well written and doesnâ€™t sound spammy. Avoid keyword cramming â€“ if your keyword usage is too dense, it can actually count against you on search results (and also alienate your readers). Bear in mind that Googleâ€™s Hummingbird update places renewed importance on long-tail keywords (ex: â€œsize 6 princess cut diamond engagement ringâ€ instead of just â€œengagement ringsâ€). Long-tail keywords have a much higher conversion rate than short-tail ones, so keep this in mind as you are developing goals and crafting copy.Â </p>
<p>Once you have your copy drafted, youâ€™ll want to add internal linking. Internal links are connections between the other pages of your website. When copywriting, include a few hyperlinks to a relevant blog post or page of your site. For best results, link to other internal pages for which you want to increase traffic. It also helps to include keywords within your anchor text (the text that comprises the hyperlink). Simply using phrases like, â€œclick hereâ€ as your anchor text isnâ€™t as beneficial as including phrases containing keywords. Donâ€™t include too many internal links, as it can count against your SEO authority, and make sure to vary your anchor text to let search engines know youâ€™re a real person and not a spam-bot.Â </p>
<p>You can give your site additional SEO power by adding keyword-optimized headings to your content. Such headings can help visually organize your pages and are one of the easiest ways to increase keyword prominence. SEO best practices are very cut and dry on proper on-page structure: your H1 tag should appear first on your page, followed by H2s and H3s. Put your keywords first in your heading tags, and keep it relevant to the copy that follows.Â </p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, proofread! If users spot a mistake, whether itâ€™s an error in grammar, punctuation or a visual, they may lose trust in your brand. It helps to have a fresh set of eyes on your copy to make sure it is polished and matches the tone of your business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember: write for your readers, but optimize for search engines!</p>

<p id="mct-ai-attriblink"><a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2014/06/11/ames-small-businesses-underuse-social-media/10291303/">Click here to view original web page at www.democratandchronicle.com</a></p>
<p>I am often asked by business owners which social media sites they should use for their small businesses, and whether they should be using social media at all.</p>
<p>My answer is always the same: it depends.</p>
<p>Many businesses believe they can make a decision whether or not to have an online business presence. Those days have been gone for a long time. A search of your business name online will likely reveal that it already exists in many places, and that clients and customers are already engaging with you online even if you are not aware of it.</p>
<p>Determining which sites to use can be overwhelming. Marketing your business through social media should be no different than marketing in any other way â€” it should be targeted to your audience.</p>
<p>Major social sites include: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Vine and Foursquare; and feedback venues like Yelp, Google+ Business, Angieâ€™s List, Yahoo! Local, Yellow Pages and Urbanspoon.</p>
<p>So how do you know which ones are best for your business?</p>
<p>Start by looking at the average age of your target audience and compare it to the average age of the siteâ€™s users. Targeting teens and twenty-somethings? Instagram may be your best bet. Busy professionals on the go? Twitterâ€™s 140-character limit broadcasts bite-sized pieces that are quick and easy to digest. Adult women? Pinterest is influential for that audience.</p>
<p>Is your product or service something that is showcased better in video? Creating a YouTube channel from which to post videos to your website and other social media sites can be advantageous.</p>
<p>Is your product or service something that most people can make a decision regarding? Like clothing or food? Or is your business selling clean rooms to hospitals? The answer to those questions will determine which sites are best for you.</p>
<p>LinkedIn, for example, is better used for business-to-business growth and personal rÃ©sumÃ© connections than Facebook or Pinterest.</p>
<p>Facebook continues to hold the largest number of subscribers with the greatest variety in utility. Users engage with each other and with business pages, games, videos, photos and more. Facebookâ€™s users range in age from teens through adults of all ages. Check-ins on Facebook mimic Foursquareâ€™s check-ins and businesses can be rated on Facebook like they can on Foursquare, Yelp and other sites.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest oversight by many businesses is the failure to claim listings on sites where clients are already engaging, sites like Angieâ€™s List, Yelp, and Google+ Business. By claiming your listing there, you have the ability to shape the customerâ€™s experience. You can upload logos and photos, and complete your listing to include contact information, hours, location and business history. You can also dialogue with members who have commented on your business â€” good and bad.</p>
<p>One of the worst things a business can do is create a social media page and not use it. The key to client engagement is business commitment. So post well, and post often.</p>

<p>While in Auckland itÂ featuresÂ in third place:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.52.29-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15866" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.52.29-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.52.29 AM" width="288" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>AndÂ worldwide, the #WorldCup hashtag hasn't even made the top 10 (at the time of writing), although the <a title="#USAvsGhana" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAvsGhana" target="_blank">#USAvsGhana</a>Â game takes top billing:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.54.33-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15867" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.54.33-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.54.33 AM" width="285" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first time I recall seeing <a title="a bespoke page dedicated to a hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldCup" target="_blank">a bespoke page dedicated to a hashtag</a> and I like it:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.58.32-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15868" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.58.32-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.58.32 AM" width="1663" height="931" /></a></p>
<p>Being able to click on View Match...</p>

<p>...and launch straight into a global <a title="hashtag feed" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GHAvsUSA" target="_blank">hashtag feed</a> of the game makes great sense:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-10.08.01-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15871" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-10.08.01-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 10.08.01 AM" width="1663" height="932" /></a></p>
<p>I thinkÂ this move by Twitter isÂ a smartÂ contribution to online publishing via social media. It's great for football fansÂ and lay-viewers alikeÂ on Twitter who are out and about, on public transport, between meetings, or sitting at a desk being able toÂ keep one eye on the score boardÂ andÂ on-the-field action, andÂ the other on their excel spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>So... can you control a hashtag?</h3>
<p>I think the answer is no; no one entity (even Twitter) can control a hashtag - even if they own the channel. I think Twitter has stomped in with a great publishing ideaÂ and has all the tools to back it by creating hashtag feed pages. But ultimatelyÂ people will tweet what they want, and this alters from country to country.</p>
<p>Twitter has however created a compelling reason to join TwitterÂ and a reason to connect with Twitter when the game is on, likelyÂ its mainÂ campaignÂ goals.Â So regardless of success of the #WorldCup hashtag, Twitter gets big tick from me. I also like that despite having what apears to be all theÂ might (and money), Twitter is still not the boss of Twitter - we are!</p>

Jason Peck below offers his 5 benefits to businesses that shift from paper to using mobile apps. Makes sense to us.</p>
</div>
<p id="mct-ai-attriblink"><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/5-business-benefits-of-shifting-from-paper-forms-to-mobile-apps-1252953">Click here to view original web page at www.techradar.com</a></p>
<p>Business adoption of new technologies often flows from the personal use of these technologies. This can certainly be said when it comes to mobile apps and devices; the ability to download an app in seconds, share photos and data via the cloud in real-time, and communicate from any location at any time have evolved from â€œnice to haveâ€ to â€œneed to have.â€</p>
<p>These consumer-grade technology expectations are just beginning to spill over to the business world. Yet, despite increased adoption of mobile devices and technologies, paper forms are burying businesses today.</p>
<p>Consider that the average office worker goes through 10,000 sheets of paper each year, which means that at an estimated cost of $40 (about Â£23.8) per case of paper, businesses are spending $80 (about Â£47.6) annually on paper per worker.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of paper not only costs your business money, but it also grinds productivity to a halt. It takes 18 minutes on average to find a paper document, and a whopping 70% of businesses would fail in three weeks if they had a catastrophic loss of paper due to a fire or flood.</p>
<h3>The technological challenges</h3>
<p>The costs and inefficiencies of paper forms are no longer lost on businesses that are ramping up efforts to shift paper forms and manual processes to mobile apps â€“ and to integrate mobility with key business processes.</p>
<p>However, getting from paper forms to mobile apps is not without technology, business and cultural challenges. Part of the reason that businesses â€“ particularly small to mid-sized firms lacking the budget or internal resources to undertake mobile IT projects â€“ cling to archaic paper processes and Excel spreadsheets is a fear that developing a custom mobile app will prove costly and time intensive.</p>
<p>Some also harbor concerns around moving hard data that exists on paper to the cloud, maintaining control and security of customer and business data, and introducing new processes to employees who are set in their ways.</p>
<p>But these obstacles continue to fade; today, mobile business apps are accessible to businesses of any size due to the benefits and economics of the cloud and Do-It-Yourself app builder tools that eliminate traditional costs associated with custom app development, reduce the need for internal IT and development resources, and speed time to market from app creation to deployment across your workforce.</p>
<p>As a result, your business can now rapidly and affordably shift from paper forms and experience five key cost saving, productivity, and customer experience benefits that a cloud-based mobile app solution delivers.</p>
<h3>1. Mobile time cards enhance workforce visibility</h3>
<p>Businesses with mobile workforces often struggle to see in real-time what workers are doing on a daily and even hourly basis, where they are at any given point in time, and if they are being as productive as they could be. Paper forms compound this problem because it can often be several hours or even days before a mobile worker returns to the office, files paperwork and enters customer and project information into your system.</p>
<p>Cloud-based mobile apps provide greater visibility into workforce productivity in several ways. For example, businesses that rely on mobile workers in the field are fully aware that time cards are crucial for tracking employee time worked and thus, labor costs for projects. Traditional time cards present their own challenges, but by creating a time card mobile app, businesses can have the time automatically entered to ensure accuracy, and that information can be sent in real-time via the cloud to the office. Greater accuracy means fewer issues, and allow you to spend less time tracking employees and more on their actual work performance.</p>
<h3>2. Mobile work orders improve workforce productivity</h3>
<p>For businesses with field workers, tracking how many jobs each employee does in a week can be cumbersome and time consuming with paper work orders. They can also be hard to read, inconsistently returned to the office, lost or damaged, and impossible to get in real time. At a more granular level, fields often arenâ€™t filled in fully or correctly, and pricing is entered or calculated incorrectly.</p>
<p>The result? Your sales cycle grinds to a halt as a result of these delays. For a business owner, paper forms make it time consuming to know which employees are productive and which ones arenâ€™t. Mobile work orders create a system that's reliable, accurate, and accessible in real time. Companies are able to use time and date stamps to show an accurate timing of when the job occurred, while built-in GPS capabilities can confirm a worker was at a job site or customer location when he or she is supposed to be there. Businesses also have the flexibility to customize the work order form fields to their specific requirements, pre-populate pricing for parts and have all of the information captured in the mobile work order form transmitted immediately via the cloud to the office, as well as to customers if required.</p>
<h3>3. Mobile GPS capabilities streamline vehicle routing</h3>
<p>A cloud-based mobile app solution can also improve routing efficiency as you dispatch workers to job sites and customer locations. With GPS location capture, business owners can visualize routes on a map, consolidate two routes into one, or even calculate date and time. A light dispatch service also allows companies to send delivery information to remote or field workers, and a careful review of routes can save hundreds of gallons of gas, as well as wear and tear on vehicles.</p>
<h3>4. Mobile inspections improve quality control</h3>
<p>For businesses charged with conducting quality control, safety and compliance inspections at work sites, paper forms introduce several vulnerabilities and inefficiencies. Workers could report inspecting a site they never visited, and workers must rewrite the same information over and over, use expensive carbon copies that are hard to read and easily lost, and are limited to text-only data.</p>
<p>Mobile inspection apps allow your business to build in time and date stamps â€“ as well as GPS location â€“ to ensure inspections are being done correctly and in accordance with company and industry regulations. Mobile inspection apps also allow for multimedia (photos, etc.) to more easily report complicated issues and provide visual proof of issues.</p>
<p>Time and date stamps as well as GPS location assure you accurate and effective inspections.</p>
<h3>5. Mobile apps transform data collection and storage</h3>
<p>Integrating mobility into core applications that your business uses every day â€“ such as Dropbox, Salesforce, Quickbooks and Evernote â€“ places a premium on effective data collection that can be easily stored and shared across the organization. With mobile data collection capabilities, your employees can fill out information anywhere and have that data stored securely in the Cloud â€“ a huge cost savings driver as each four-drawer filing cabinet costs a firm $1,500 (about Â£893) annually. By using Application Program Interfaces (APIs), your business can easily integrate data collected via mobile apps with your own systems. Finally, with mobile data collection capabilities, your business can collect an expanded set of information beyond text through image capture, barcode scanning, e-signatures and GPS.</p>
<p>Cloud mobile business app solutions are now simple and powerful to use, and lead to significant and immediate productivity gains and cost savings for businesses with mobile workers that are reliant on paper forms.</p>

<p>Virality. Itâ€™s a topic of mystery and longing. All brands long to go viral, but for most brands, going about creating viral content is a mystery.Â There is no secret recipe for the perfect viral video, and yet there are videos that receive millions of views every year. Whatâ€™s the secret?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, virality is more of an art than a science. While there is no tried-and-true formula for virality, there are some elements that we consistently see -- and knowing what they are puts you one step closer to attaining that viral glory.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at some of the research that's been done on viral videos and identify some of the commonalities that can make them internet-famous.Â </p>
<h2><strong>The Science of Virality</strong></h2>
<p>Though there have been many analyses on why content goes viral, we're going to dive into two key sources: a study by Elon University and a book by Jonah Berger, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Wharton, calledÂ <em>Contagious: Why Things Catch On.</em></p>
<h3><strong>1) Elon University Study</strong></h3>
<p>Elon University conducted a <a href="http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/academics/communications/research/vol2no1/08West.pdf">study</a> on the factors that make content go viral. They evaluated 20 of the most viral videos on the web, as determined by <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1974961,00.html">Time Magazine</a>, and recorded their various characteristics. The goal was to identify certain factors that may have contributed to the videoâ€™s virality.</p>

<h4><strong>8 Common Characteristics of Viral Videos</strong></h4>
<p>Upon analyzing these videos, a few factors were determined to be the most prevalent (and therefore most important for creating a viral video):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title length:Â </strong>75% of the videos had short titles (3 words or less), with the average title length being 2.76 words.Â </li>
<li><strong>Run-time:</strong>Â 60% of the videos had short run-times (3 minutes or less), with an average run-time of 2 minutes and 47 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Element of laughter</strong>:Â 30% of the videos featured the element of laughter (defined as seeing or hearing someone laughing within the first 30 seconds of the video).</li>
<li><strong>Element of surprise:</strong>Â 50% of the videos exhibited the element of surprise (defined as seeing or hearing an expression of surprise, such as a scream or gasp).</li>
<li><strong>Element of irony:Â </strong>90% of the videos featured an element of irony (defined as an element contrary to what was expected). The majority of ironic elements in the videos displayed the breaking of social norms.</li>
<li><strong>Musical quality</strong>: 60% of the videos displayed a musical element (defined as singing, background music, or popular song references).</li>
<li><strong>Youth</strong>:Â 35% of the videos featured children seemingly under the age of 18. 20% of them displayed children seemingly under the age of 10.</li>
<li><strong>Talent</strong>:Â 30% of the videos were composed of songs, dances, or performances that required practice and talent.
<h3><strong>2) Jonah Berger, Author ofÂ <em>Contagious: Why Things Catch On</em></strong></h3>
<p>Jonah Berger, New York Times bestselling author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contagious-Why-Things-Catch-On/dp/1451686579">Contagious: Why Things Catch On</a></em>, was also interested in what makes content go viral. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/04/25/jonah-berger-how-to-make-your-marketing-campaigns-go-viral/">Based on his years of experience in the marketing industry</a>, Berger believesÂ that word of mouth is more effective and more important than conventional advertising because, â€œwe donâ€™t listen to ads, we listen to our social ties.â€</p>
<p>And word of mouth largely depends on motivation. You need to create video content that appeals to people enough for them to <em>want</em> to share it with their networks.Â In <em>Contagious</em>,Â Berger identifies six key principles (or STEPPS)Â that motivate people to share content:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Social currency:</strong>Â People share things that make them look good to others.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers:</strong>Â The stimuli that prompt people to think about your product or campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Emotion:</strong> People are more likely to share things that are emotionally arousing (with positive emotions being more viral than negative ones).</li>
<li><strong>Public:</strong>Â People are more likely to participate if their participation can be readily made public (such as â€œI Votedâ€ stickers and wrist bands for causes).</li>
<li><strong>Practical value:</strong> People are more likely to share practical pieces of information, so they can help their friends and families.</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong>:Â People are programmed to recognize, respond to and share compelling stories.
<p>Like I mentioned in the introduction, even with all of this data around viral videos, there's no set formula -- that's where the art comes in. Read on to learn how to use this data in the every-day.Â </p>
<h2><strong>The Art of Viral Videos: Applying Data to Real-Life Scenarios</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the findings of both studies, it would seem that the ideal viral video contains some combination of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a short title (3 words or less) and a short run-time (3 minutes or less)</li>
<li>Is told in pre-rehearsed story format</li>
<li>Is emotionally arousing</li>
<li>Makes you laugh</li>
<li>Involves elements of irony and/or surprise</li>
<li>Allows participation to be made public</li>
<li>Is practically useful</li>
<li>Features young children
<p>Great. Now all you have to do is translate this list to craft a unique, viral message that represents your specific brand. Easy, right?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Some of these items (like a short title and run-time) are self-explanatory. But others (like story format, elements of irony and surprise, public indicators of participation, and practical use) may not be as evident, so here are some tips for addressing these more complex factors.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell a Story</strong></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of language, humans have been programmed to consume stories. In fact, <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/science-of-storytelling-why-telling-a-story-is-the-most-powerful-way-to-activate-our-brains">stories activate chemicals in our minds </a>that provide sensory experiences and influence our way of thinking. Because of these chemicals and responses, people are naturally attracted to content thatâ€™s in conventional story format.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, this is easy to do, because you are human and your brain is already programmed to share stories! Just make sure you have the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychology-of-stories-storytelling-formula">traditional elements of a narrative</a> (beginning, character, conflict, climax, and resolution) present in your video, and your viewers will identify it as a story.</p>
<p>You could also experiment with using well-known tropes in your video as well -- for example, a mother constantly cleaning her kitchen becomes Cinderella, or a young boy tells a lie and his nose grows like Pinnochio.</p>
<p>For example, Oreoâ€™s â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfD2xyOWm6U">Wonder if I Gave an Oreo</a>â€ video is a cartoon ad that imagines giving an Oreo to common story characters like the Big Bad Wolf and a vampire. The ad narrates how giving an Oreo to these characters would alter their stories, making them friendlier and giving the stories a happier ending.Â This kind of video is a cute, funny way of incorporating that theme while still focusing on the brand.</p>
<h3><strong>Be Ironic</strong></h3>
<p>As the Elon University study found, irony is the most common factor among viral videos at an astounding 90% of surveyed videos. That makes it a pretty high priority when crafting your viral message.</p>
<p>How do you incorporate irony? You do what the majority of the sample videos did -- you demonstrate the breaking of social norms.</p>
<p>Think:Â Are there any social norms associated with your brand or product? Is there any way that you can break one of those relevant norms in an ironic yet on-brand way?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example. Marvel published a brilliantly ironic video for the release of Thor in 2011. Called â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPNjWWQqWCA">Little Thor</a>,â€ the video is a parody of the adorable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R55e-uHQna0">Volkswagen Super Bowl commercial</a> that starred a little boy dressed as Darth Vader trying to harness the power of the force.Â In â€œLittle Thor,â€ a girl dressed as Thor is going around the house, trying to use Thorâ€™s hammer to wield great power on the dog (appropriately named Loki), a doll, and her peanut butter and jelly sandwich.Â </p>
<p>As we watch this, itâ€™s practically identical to the Volkswagen commercial, and we assume that itâ€™s probably another video in the same series. In the end, the father comes home, and she runs outside for one last attempt with her hammer. We assume that her father will sound the carâ€™s alarm, just as the father did in the VW Super Bowl commercial, but instead -- the car explodes! We then realize that this commercial is not for Volkswagen, but for the upcoming Thor movie.</p>
<p>This video is ironic on multiple levels. First, itâ€™s an ironic parody of a popular ad. Second, the child dressed as Thor is a girl, which goes against gender stereotypes (and breaks a social norm). Third, the car explodes, which is ironic since the video is a spoof of a car commercial.</p>
<p>An ironic video like that is a humorous way to introduce people to your brand personality.</p>
<h3><strong>Surprise the Audience</strong></h3>
<p>Half of the viral videos contained an element of surprise.</p>
<p>Why do people like to be surprised? In a world where we view thousands of ads a day, people are tired of seeing the same things over and over. A surprise is a nice, refreshing change of pace to all that monotonous content.</p>
<p>So how do you incorporate elements of surprise while still making your video relevant to your company?</p>
<p>Your company should be the surprise.</p>
<p>To be more specific, the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/features-vs-benefits-messaging-ht">benefits that your company provides</a> should be the (pleasant, funny, positive, etc.) surprise element to your video.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s say that you sell inserts for shoes to make them more comfortable. You could show a video of a woman, strenuously climbing a desert mountain in the sun amidst various obstacles. Weâ€™re rooting for her to get to the top, and when she does -- the camera looks down to her feet, and weâ€™re surprised to see that sheâ€™s been wearing high heels this whole time.</p>
<p>Thanks to your cushy inserts, she was able to climb a mountain in notoriously uncomfortable footwear.</p>
<p>A video like that is a fun, surprising, and memorable way to casually share your product benefits online.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, you can exaggerate them. Old Spiceâ€™s â€œ<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE">The Man Your Man Could Smell Like</a>â€ video campaign is an excellent example of using a surprise element to exaggerate the benefits of their body wash in a fun, ironic way.</p>
<p>The ad features a towel-clad actor in a bathroom with the shower running behind him. He says that, while your man is unfortunately not him, your man could smell like him with Old Space body wash. Then suddenly, the shower backdrop is pulled right out from behind him to reveal that he is on a boat! Heâ€™s holding a clam in his hand with tickets to â€œyour favorite thingâ€ in them. Look again, and the clam has transformed into flowing diamonds! A bottle of Old Spice rises up from within the diamonds, while the camera pans down to reveal that the actor is now on a horse.Â With the constantly changing wardrobe, props and backdrop, viewers are constantly surprised and excited to see just what â€œthe man your man could smell likeâ€ will do next.</p>
<p>While not every brand has the budget to do a video like Old Spice, think about how you can surprise your audience in both small and big ways -- it could help your video get shared.</p>
<h3><strong>Encourage Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>Berger said that people are more likely to participate if they can publicly indicate their participation. Why? Because people like to show off and feel like theyâ€™re in the know.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s easy to do for people who interact with you in person -- a branded t-shirt, bumper sticker, or pen will do the job just fine. But itâ€™s harder to provide public indicators of participation for people who interact with you online.</p>
<p>Correction: it <em>was</em> harder to provide them before social media came around.</p>
<p>Nowadays, <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx">social sharing buttons</a> are on practically every form of online content there is: YouTube videos, website articles, audio clips, etc. This is to allow people to share the content they enjoy with their friends, who can then share it with their friends, etc.</p>
<p>By incorporating social sharing buttons on your videos and wherever you end up hosting them, you meet your audienceâ€™s need to share their experience with others.</p>
<h3><strong>Think Practicality</strong></h3>
<p>The two things we all have in common is that we all have problems, and weâ€™re all looking for solutions to fix them.</p>
<p>From self-diagnosing an illness to looking up recipes for a last-minute potluck dinner, people search for informational content all the time. Chances are, your customers are looking for information regarding your field or industry as well. And itâ€™s in your best interest to provide it for them.</p>
<p>By creating a practical, useful video, you accomplish a few very important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You provide information to people who prefer to seek it on their own.</li>
<li>You can encourage those people to then share that information with their networks (accommodating those who seek advice from their friends).</li>
<li>You establish yourself as a helpful tool and source of information, increasing trust (and hopefully loyalty).</li>
<li>If you have strategically placed <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-call-to-action-faqs-ht">calls-to-action</a> in your video, you could hopefully convert viewers to the next stage of the buying journey.
<p>Is there any way that your video can provide practical information that your customers might be looking for? A good first step is to identify a problem your customers are having, and then provide information as to how they can fix it.Â </p>
<p>Maybe you sell makeup, and you have a lot of customers who arenâ€™t sure how and when to apply it -- you could create a how-to video for tips and tricks to apply makeup.Â Or maybe your company provides eye exams, but a lot of first-time children are scared of the visit --Â you could film a tour of your office, with a step-by-step explanation of the eye exam for mothers to show their children.</p>
<p>By providing this useful information, you help people associate you with solutions -- which'll come in handy when they want to buy something down the road.</p>
<p>Take Pillsburyâ€™s video for â€œ<a href="http://www.pillsbury.com/holidays-celebrations/halloween/how-to-make-crescent-mummy-dogs">Crescent Mummy Dogs</a>,â€ for example. Itâ€™s an instructional video that shows how you can make a fun, playful dish for your children at Halloween. Parents might be searching for a recipe like this for their childâ€™s school party, and Pillsbury has provided not only the recipe, but also a how-to video to accompany it.Â This way, they make completing this recipe as easy as possible, so parents who try it love it and will be more likely to share it with their friends -- and heck, maybe even buy Pillsbury dough to make the recipe.</p>
<h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for the perfect viral video, but there is a general guideline.Â By understanding the elements that make content successful, you can predict (and even create) the content that will become popular in the future.Â This information is crucial for successful viral marketing campaigns, as it will allow you to strategically create videos that are more likely to be widely distributed online.</p>

Below, New York-basedÂ journalistÂ <a title="Donna Fuscalo" href="http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/archive/donna-fuscaldo/index.html" target="_blank">Donna Fuscalo</a> talks to the experts to see what words small businesses most need to know and breaks it downÂ for you.</p>

<p>Do you know how to use social media for your small business? Most small business owners know what a tweet and a like is, but ask them about a hashtag, meme, trending, or geotargeting and chances are theyâ€™ll give you a blank stare in response.</p>
<p>Those terms may seem trendy and downright silly, but if you want to grow your small business in this era of mobile and social media you better know what they mean.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œThere are some terms that are really import for small business people to know,â€ says Jay York, a social media strategist at EMSI Public Relations. â€œActually making active use of these terms will allow them to increase their business.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the basic to the outlandish, hereâ€™s a look at five terms social media experts say all small business owners need to know.</p>
<h2><b>How to use social media for business: terms to know</b></h2>
<h3><b>Trending</b></h3>
<p>Top 50 or 100 lists have been around for ages, but in the world of social media whatâ€™s popular isnâ€™t that anymore, rather itâ€™s trending. Trending â€œhighlights the frequently buzzed-about items being discussed around the web at any given moment,â€ says Folke Lemaitre, founder and chief executive of Engagor, a social media management company.Â  So why should small business owners care about whatâ€™s trending on Twitter or Youtube?Â  According to Lemaitre, it provides an opportunity for the business owner to take part in the ongoing conversation with people who are already engaged in it.Â </p>
<h3><b>Hashtag</b></h3>
<p>How do businesses use <a title="hashtags" href="http://aboutus.co.nz/glossary/hashtag" target="_blank">hashtags</a> on social media? Hashtag is one of those social media terms small business owners are familiar with but have no clue what they are supposed to do with it. Hashtags are used to classify and categorize content on social networks, whether itâ€™s Twitter or Facebook. With a hashtag, users can tag posts, pictures and videos with a hash symbol (#) followed by a word or phrase. This allows the social media site to categorize posts based on like terms, which in turn makes it easier for people to search for similar and related posts. â€œSmall business owners need to understand that each network uses hashtags differently and should be aware of how to properly hashtag,â€ says Eileen Bernardo, senior social media strategist at <a href="https://www.viralheat.com/">Viralheat</a>, the social management platform company. â€œFor example, hashtagging just to hashtag is not efficient - with hashtags, less is more. When used strategically, they can be very powerful on social media.â€</p>
<h3><b>Selfie</b></h3>
<p>What else can social media do for your business? <a title="Selfies" href="http://aboutus.co.nz/glossary/selfie" target="_blank">Selfies</a>, or photos someone takes of themselves using a mobile device can also help grow the business. â€œIt's not just limited to celebrities, teenagers, and the eternally vain,â€ says Julie Joyce, owner of Link Fish Media, an Internet link building company. â€œEven the realty giant Berkshire Hathaway is pushing the selfie on their Facebook page.â€</p>
<p>So how can small businesses use selfies to their advantage? According to Joyce it can be a way for companies to show their â€œrealâ€ side and encourage interaction with customers and potential ones. Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œIt's a very modern version of what tons of companies have been doing for years, when they'd have readers submit a photo of themselves reading a certain magazine in exotic locales or wearing a brand's t-shirt all over the world,â€ she says.Â Â </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>Geotargeting</b></h3>
<p>For small businesses, location is everything. Regardless of the number of storefronts you have, you want to target your advertising and marketing to customers in your area and thatâ€™s where geotargeting comes in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œSegmenting your message to reach those close to your storefront means you can customize your message to your target audience,â€ says Bernard. â€œFor example, if you are a local business in Central California, you can target your message to reach people within the area and offer a 24 hour coupon or sale for them to come in and redeem.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geotargeting may seem complex, but according to York the simple way is to hashtag their neighborhood or city when posting information. â€œIf small businesses want to geo target they can tweet the location they are in making sure to capitalize on anyone searching through hashtag,â€ he says.</p>
<h3><b>Meme</b></h3>
<p>Meme may sound like a made up word, but itâ€™s actually used to describe something that is â€œculturallyâ€ current or significant that takes on a life of its own and goes viral, says York.Â  A meme could be gesture made by a famous person or a funny video on YouTube that everyone is talking about and/or putting their own spin on. Being on top of memes wonâ€™t only make you more interesting, particularly to the younger generations, but it can also afford the business owner the opportunity to get some free exposure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œThe point is not to make a sale right then and there, but to be interesting so people want to connect with you and then down the road want to buy product from you,â€ says York.</p>

The three were puzzling over "technology" concernedÂ chiefly aboutÂ being "left behind". In my mother's case, this is not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She has an iPhone and an iPadÂ (which she syncs with iCloud), a Kindle, a laptop and a desktop PC. She actively uses Facebook, Facebook Messenger, YouTube, Skype and Shazm, Googles <em>everything</em> from recipes to directions, downloads information from Wikipedia, reads global news apps on her iPad,Â and uses Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (although less frequently). The others are active users of email and mobile phones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During our conversation, myÂ mother recalled when she was young makingÂ a "toll-call" to New PlymouthÂ from Woodville in the Manawatu meantÂ contacting the exchange and putting in a request, which may or may not have been granted that evening or the next. Today, she marvels that she can send my sister, who is currently in Paris, a messageÂ in Facebook Messenger or send a picture in Snapchat and sheÂ replies immediately. She also is staggered that kids in school today are preparing for careers that do not yet exist (in fact, this is as true of current university students, so fast is the pace of change).</p>
<h3>The point of social media</h3>
<p>What stood out for me in this chat was the emphasis the three placed on the <em>technology</em>Â rather thanÂ the <em>purpose</em> of these tools and channels.Â Our use of technology is fundamentallyÂ about <strong>connecting, communicating, belonging</strong> and in the case of civil revolution, <strong>making change happen</strong>. And none of this is new; these ways of being are historically aboutÂ our survival as humans. Yes, social media isÂ one means of <em>how</em> we achieve connection, communication, belongingÂ and changeÂ but they are not <em>why</em> we do it. And the secret to technological change lies in the why.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Fundamentally, evolution of technology is about making lives better.Â <em style="font-style: italic;">How</em>Â is by connecting, communicating, belonging and making change happen, andÂ <em style="font-style: italic;">What</em>Â is by using tools and channels such as smartphones, tablets and Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Wordpress and more.</span></p>
<p>Yes, the technology is alwaysÂ changing, and we can choose to adapt or not, but ultimatelyÂ <em>it will never pass us by</em>. We will always need to connect with our world, communicate, belong and be part of change, and this will drive our desire to jump on one social media channel or another and get the technology to support it (sooner or later).Â </p>
<h3>Being talked <em>at</em> vs. beingÂ talked <em>with</em></h3>
<p>I then suggested that this evolution of tools and channels is a <em>good</em> thing; thatÂ <span class="Apple-style-span">social media has hailed in an era of human andÂ brand<strong> authenticity</strong></span>. In the case of being human, the longer you're in social media the harder it would be to sustain falsehoods. You cannot lie in LinkedIn for example, because someone in a workplace youÂ professed to work atÂ will call you out.Â </p>
<p>The best bit, is that<strong> every voice inÂ social media is equal</strong>. AÂ brand can't just advertise and tell us that it has great products and services; they mustÂ deliver. If there is a mis-match in a brand's claims, people using social media will share their experienceÂ of usingÂ aÂ product or service: good, bad or ugly. Similarly, in New Zealand, we have the possibility ofÂ direct contact with our politicians, which is unprecedented since lining up to have an audience with a King or Queen. As MP Jacinda Ardern told an Auckland audience this May, tweets come directly to her phone as would a text and she reads every one, adding that it's "impossible" to ignore the collective sentiment within them, though nor would she want to.</p>
<p>So to those afraid of upgrading their "technology" or of using social media - particularly if you're inÂ business - please don't be. These are merely the accessories and extensions of your human experience and ultimately exist because someone wanted to make your life better.</p>

<p>ABC's Carl Smith and Clarissa Thorpe share stories on how Ozzie businesses are getting it right.</p>

<p>More Australian businesses are advertising their products online and through social media, but smaller companies are reportedly lagging behind.</p>
<p>The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows almost half of businesses have a website or web presence, and just over one quarter are active on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>But larger companies are outperforming smaller ones in both areas.</p>
<p>In June last year, 98 per cent of businesses with 200 or more staff had an online presence, and two thirds were active on social media.</p>
<p>Although small businesses are starting to move online, many say the time commitments can be onerous.</p>
<p>Canberra artist Deborah Anne is part of a growing trend of home-based businesses using social media as a voice to generate sales.</p>
<p>Initially she started selling her three-dimensional paper pictures at the markets, through craft website Etsy and on Facebook.</p>
<p>But she is currently building her own website to attract more sales.</p>
<p>"I think people expect it, though not everybody is on Facebook and that's why I need to get the website up and running as well," Ms Anne said.</p>
<p>"I can put photos up there so people have a visual thing to see what I'm all about. I've had contact from people all around Australia and even internationally."</p>
<p>It is an experience shared by hobby horse maker Michael Holmes who is based in the southern New South Wales village of Bungendore.</p>
<p>He has a large online presence, with profiles on Twitter, Facebook, Etsy and Instagram and an individual business website.</p>
<p>"We get a lot of people enquire online and through Facebook and then come to see us at the markets, to see what the product is like before they actually buy it, especially the large rocking horses," Mr Holmes said.</p>
<p>"The traffic varies. Obviously the month before Christmas is really busy with orders but generally all through the year we might get enquires up to 10 o'clock at night."</p>
<p>Mr Holmes recently joined an art co-op which wants to open a retail store in Canberra later this year, but said the online contact would remain an important part of his business model.</p>
<p>"People like that. Everyone asks us if we are local," he said.</p>
<p>"And I find people like to buy from local people, not from big companies, especially when the product is handmade."</p>
<p>Nationally the proportion of companies with a web presence is slowly rising, and social media activity has jumped from 18 per cent of companies to 26 per cent in the 12 months to June 2013.</p>
<p>The increased online activity is matched with more sales for Australian businesses.</p>
<p>Internet orders during 2012-2013 were worth close to $250 billion, an increase of almost $10 billion from the previous year.</p>
