We're¬†a New Zealand-based digital innovation agency, and we specialise in building online communities.¬†We also produce video content for cloud software companies like Xero, Vend, Unleashed and Geo Op, so we're passionate about how the cloud can transform business.

Over the last few years we have noticed the New Zealand small business community has been slow to adopt social media and move to the cloud. Somewhere between 50 and 65% of SME's don't even have a website. With more than 80% of Kiwis starting their purchase journeys with a Google search, that's a big problem. ¬†So we wanted to build something that made it easy and free for a small business owners to get online, use the internet better, get more customers and make more money.

With About Us, we have tipped the expensive, old directory model on its head. Google is the only directory that counts now, and getting found is free. This means paying for expensive listings, bold headings and ads is a thing of the past. ¬†So rather than charge for listings or a templated website, we're delivering every business in New Zealand an effective web presence, for free. We're making it easy for business owners to connect their social media accounts to their page, and delivering content that explains how to use those tools to build a customer community. We're also providing a free dashboard, so business owners can monitor and manage how they are tracking online. And if a business owner is ready to move to the cloud, our Cloud Store allows them to compare and buy all of the apps they need to transform their business.

It's a real concern to us that New Zealand seems to be lagging behind online. There's no reason for it: the New Zealand business community has the opportunity to be the world leader in digital capability. We're the home of Xero, which is at the centre of a cloud ecosystem that any small business can easily plug into. We have the infrastructure, with Chorus rolling out Ultra Fast Broadband. And as a country which relies on overseas markets, we <em>need</em> to be good at this stuff.

So thanks for joining us, and we hope we can help you get better at using the internet. If you have any suggestions on how we can do a better job, we'd love to hear from you: please <a title="hello@aboutus.co.nz" href="mailto:hello@aboutus.co.nz" target="_blank">drop us a line.</a>
