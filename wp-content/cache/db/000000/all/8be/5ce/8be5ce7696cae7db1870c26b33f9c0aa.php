<p><a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/10/xero-small-business-accounting-software-funding.html">Xero raised $150 million last year</a> largely from U.S. investors to increase its presence in the U.S. market. Now the cloud accounting firm says itâ€™s seen a 200 percent increase in customers hereÂ since 2013.</p>
<p>The actual number of customers is still pretty small â€” just 18,000 in North America. Thatâ€™s compared to much bigger numbers in Australia and its native New Zealand.</p>
<p>The annual report for the companyâ€™s fiscal year ending March 31 was released this week. Company heads said they are committed to growing their business here focused on the small business market.</p>
<p>In the report, Chief Executive Rod Drury and Chairman Chris Liddell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œDuring this phase we developed a detailed understanding of the U.S. market, and with that knowledge and experience Xero is now building out the balance of the management team and moving appropriate global functions to the U.S. While independent product reviews place Xero strongly against competitors, there are numerous opportunities to create a â€˜best in classâ€™ product for the U.S. market. U.S. specific product development will be a significant focus in the forthcoming year.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New leadership added this year to aid the expansion includes Liddell, who the company calls its independent New York-based chairman of the board. Liddell formerly served both as Vice Chairman and CFO at General Motors and as Senior Vice President and CFO at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Another addition is new CEO of North America, Peter Karpas, who the company says has strong experience in the U.S. small business market.</p>
<p>Xero has also strengthened the U.S. presence on its board of directors with appointment of Bill Veghte. Veghte is the Vice President and Manager of HPâ€™s Enterprise Group.</p>
<p>The company has also increased its U.S. based workforce with an additional 376 employees added mainly in the U.S.</p>
<p>The increase in U.S. staffing has included new software and marketing teams based in San Francisco and a new contact, sales and operation center in Denver.</p>
<p>Xero executives say they have also built a support â€œecosystemâ€ of more than 300 partners. These include accounting firms who use the companyâ€™s software and other third party small business service providers.</p>

I'm an Aucklander living a short walk away from the CBD. I work, gym and play about 25 hours perÂ day, and say yes to (almost) every opportunity that comes my way. Suffice to say I love to look and feel good all of those hours.Â And suffice to say I really, <em>really</em> don't.Â </p>
<p>Enter my beauty and therapy saviour: <a title="Flossie Concierge" href="https://www.flossie.com/help/what-is-flossie-concierge" target="_blank">Flossie Concierge</a>. If you're familiar with concepts like <a title="lastminute.com" href="http://www.lastminute.co.nz/" target="_blank">lastminute.com</a>Â and <a title="Uber" href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a>,Â you'll understand the concept of consumer-led,Â last minuteÂ requests: <em>"I want... who wants me?" </em></p>
<p>When Uber launched in 2009, it sought to solve two business problems: taxis waiting for business; and consumers wanting taxis <em>"Now!"</em>. The Uber team <a title="created an app" href="https://www.uber.com/about" target="_blank">createdÂ an app</a> that connects these two groups without the need for dialogue, and has now connected 70 cities, including our own centralÂ <a title="Auckland" href="https://www.uber.com/cities/auckland" target="_blank">Auckland</a>. Bye bye call centre; hello faster service with the control back in the hands of drivers and travellers.</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/flossie-concierge-is-coming/"><img class="alignleft" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-logo-concierge-bp1.png" alt="Flossie Concierge is COMING - Be Ready!" width="281" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>With this in mind, CEO and Founder of <a title="Flossie.com" href="https://www.flossie.com" target="_blank">Flossie.com</a>Â <a title="Jenene Crossman" href="nz.linkedin.com/pub/jenene-crossan/b/643/41a" target="_blank">Jenene Crossan</a> set out to solve the busy woman challenge (and men too, but Flossie has a definite female skew), pairing it with salons Auckland-wide with availableÂ last minute appointments. Crossan and her talented webÂ development teamÂ created Flossie Concierge and are currently putting it through its testing paces before launching onÂ iOS and Android soon.Â </p>
<p>Flossie Concierge is <em>the</em>Â app for consumers to request on-demand hair beauty and therapy appointments on that day, or in the days following (it's not a forward booking system).Â ItÂ alsoÂ solves a massive small business problem in the health and beauty sector,Â which is the inability for most salonsÂ and spas to fill empty on-the-day appointments (without a blackboard outside to entice walk-ins, or clever Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts - if they are even in fact using social media).</p>
<p>It works by consumers making a health or beautyÂ request - for say, a therapeutic massage, an eyebrow shape, a manicure,Â or hair cut and colourÂ -Â all of which takes about 20 seconds:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-01.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15625 size-large" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-01-219x390.png" alt="flossie-01" width="219" height="390" /></a><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-02.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15626" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-02-219x390.png" alt="flossie-02" width="219" height="390" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-03.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15627" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-03-219x390.png" alt="flossie-03" width="219" height="390" /></a><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-04.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15628" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/flossie-04-219x390.png" alt="flossie-04" width="219" height="390" /></a></p>
<p>A desktop alert is sent to relevant salons and spas and they can send a message immediately offering up to three appointments, whichÂ are sent directly back to the request originator. From there they can browse the options, select the one that appeals most,Â buy it directly within the app, and add it to their smartphoneÂ calendar. The salon receives a desktop message notification and they can then confirm the appointment in their booking system.</p>
<p><a title="Flossie salons and spas" href="https://www.flossie.com/our-salons-and-spas" target="_blank">Flossie salons and spas</a> are selected for their quality of service, style and consistency. The app has been introduced to many of the FlossieÂ participating salon owners all of whom are praising its innovation and are excited to get rolling. Flossie has grown a massive database of users all eager to give Flossie Concierge a go.</p>
<p>I think this app is at the beginning of the wave where consumers lead the drive for small business products and services. I can see this app working for dentists, mechanics, physiotherapists, plumbers and more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>: You need four new tyres and there's an app to load inÂ make, model and year of your car, and tyre businesses replies immediatelyÂ with cost and delivery. That's what we're talking about!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>â€œIf there are any points on which you require explanation or further particulars we shall be glad to furnish such additional details as may be required by telephone.â€</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the?! This could simply be written as: â€œIf you have any questions, please phone.â€</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a bit of a hokey example, but it is no exaggeration that while the business trend is towards speaking plainly, we still find this kind of bureaucratic doublespeak cropping up.</p>
<p>â€œTell me in plain Englishâ€ is a request we are hearing more and more often. But people who are able to speak with clarity and articulate complex ideas in speech, seem when writing to fall into a kind of language designed to impress rather than inform. Others worry that simplifying their writing is dumbing things down and contributing to a decline in the literacy standards of the free world.</p>
<p>But what happens when we use convoluted sentences, inflated vocabulary and specialist terms? Instead of impressing our reader we probably confuse and annoy them.</p>
<p>If you want your message read, your meaning understood and action taken, then here are four things to keep in front of you while writing emails, letters and reports.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use only as many words as are necessary to carry the message</strong>. Padding it out and buffering your key idea only confuses the reader who has to search for the reason you are writing. If that is hidden in a bushel of other language, they may give up and not read to the end or look any further than the first paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid long words, jargon and acronyms</strong>. Living in our own little world, we often forget that others do not know what a CIO might be or the relevance of the AQTF to their training request. Use the everyday word for things and write as you speak, in short sentences. Using jargon, acronyms and long sentences makes the message more confusing and the likelihood of the letter going into the too hard basket or the bin that much higher.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use short sentences</strong>. Aim for between 15-20 words where possible to help your reader take in the information swiftly.</p>
<p><strong>4. Donâ€™t be afraid to give directions when you are writing instructions</strong>. We often see sentences like 'You are required to return the formâ€™ instead of 'Return the form.'</p>
<p><a title="Tim Costello" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Costello" target="_blank">Tim Costello</a> recently remarked in a radio interview that the main reason we don't trust politicians is because they don't speak to us in plain English. So this is not just a communication issue, but a way of building trust with the people you work with every day.</p>
<p>By the way, I have just put this article through a readability test and it comes up as written to a Year Nine US reading level. Thatâ€™s not because I think you canâ€™t read beyond that level, but because I know you are busy people who want to take in the message and get the action hints as quickly as possible.</p>

I have beaten a path down some of New Zealandâ€™s most exclusive streets â€“ from Herne Bay, Ponsonby, Parnell, Devonport, Takapuna, Newmarket, Epsom and Remuera. And you may be as surprised as I am to learn that some of these businesses are barely using the Internet at all â€“ let alone accessing cloud services or transferring their social skills to social media.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebigupgradeblog.tumblr.com/post/81415666821/thirty-four-billion-freaking-dollars">The $34 billion dollar loss story</a> is real, and itâ€™s happening right now on our most affluent doorsteps. And this is a profound failure.</p>
<p>Make no mistake; these salon owners are savvy, smart business operators at the <em>very</em> top of their game. <em>But</em> the Internet â€“ or those who hold the knowledge on how the Internet can enable better business productivity and efficiency â€“ has passed them by. They have been left completely in the dark, and every day this should cause alarm to the telcos, cloud service companies, people building new technology, and the people running our country.</p>
<p>We behind desks have our heads in the cloud. Literally.</p>
<p>What's more, there have been so many snake oil salespeople and â€œgurusâ€ taint the market that the mere mention of the word â€œappâ€ is greeted with suspicion. I am just another trickster out to hustle their well-earned dollar. (I met a small business owner the other day who had a charlatan offer to set them up with GeoOp for $500 when install is free, quick and simple and begins with a no-cost trial. Thatâ€™s a pretty good business model: installing a free cloud service for $500 a time).</p>
<p>Something has to be done and it must be done very bloody fast, or we all might as well pack up and go home.Â Â </p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/book-keeping.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-15806 size-medium" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/book-keeping-266x266.jpg" alt="book-keeping" width="266" height="266" /></a>Back to the Auckland businesses I am visiting. It is not unusual for these salons and spas to run entirely on paper â€“ from stock inventory, appointment bookings through to accounts. Itâ€™s also not unusual for the business to have no computer or wifi access â€“ or even a business email address (I counted three on Aucklandâ€™s High Street). And for the businesses that do have wifi, about five per cent know their wifi password.</p>
<p>Some of these businesses â€“ full of hugely talented, marvellously skilled people â€“ run their operations in the year 1995. Getting these spas and salons â€“ that form the heart of Kiwi small businesses and employ the largest part of our population â€“ into using social media and cloud apps is, frankly, daydreaming to the nth degree. As it stands, this is not going to happen.</p>
<p>So what are we going to do about it?</p>
<p>This is a New Zealand problem and it needs a dedicated, swift, comprehensive New Zealand solution. Big business needs to link arms and form a sustainable, affordable solution that enables, educates and equips small businesses to use the Internet for better business. And itâ€™s happening. <a href="http://aboutus.co.nz">About Us</a> has support of big business and is on a mission to bring the best of the worldâ€™s knowledge on topics from e-commerce, blogging, SEO, cloud services, mobile hardware onto the screens of small business owners. Weâ€™re giving every business owner a free business web profile page, and educating them by showcasing exemplars and the best apps to make their business bottom line better.</p>
<p><em>But</em> we have to ensure we gain the trust of a community that has been sold many lemons, and that all Kiwi businesses have access to the technology to join the digital business age. And it's up to all of us.</p>

<p>"We have the opportunity for the first time, instead of focussing our business around a piece of copper wire or a piece of fibre, we now can truly centre our business around you, our customer."</p>

We'll be debating the topic:Â <em><span lang="EN-GB">Have new media channels rendered traditional PR dead?</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/inside-story.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15830" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/inside-story.png" alt="inside-story" width="942" height="194" /></a></p>
<p>While I'll be arguing the affirmative, I think the truth lies moreÂ inÂ that PR companies need to take hold of and <em>master</em> new mediaÂ tools - such as blogs and social media - and use them less to "market" and get "key messages" out, and more to lead, listen and connect. And this takes boldness from the people who employ PR professionals.</p>
<p>Authentic PR delivery isÂ the result of research - and part of that research involves listening to your customers and potential customers. What do they want, and do they want what you're offering?</p>
<p>My attention was drawn to this week's,Â <em>The Washington Post</em>'s <a title="Job of the Week" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/job-of-the-week-riding-the-rails-to-craft-amtraks-social-media-strategy/2014/06/13/86069b54-f184-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html" target="_blank">Job of the Week</a>.Â <span style="color: #333333;">Amtrakâ€™s director of social media <a title="Julie Quinn" href="https://twitter.com/JuliaAQuinn" target="_blank">Julie Quinn</a> talks with web editor <a title="Sarah Halzack" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/sarah-halzack" target="_blank">Sarah Halzack</a>Â and shares Amtrak's social media strategy:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-11.32.23-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15832" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-16-at-11.32.23-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-16 at 11.32.23 AM" width="641" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I think stands out inÂ this statement is that <a title="Amtrak" href="https://twitter.com/Amtrak" target="_blank">Amtrak</a>Â prioritises listening to customer feedback, whether it's good, bad or ugly. Naturally, the chain of command back into the business needs to receive the feedback in good faith and act upon it. (Otherwise the exercise is pointless).</p>
<p>I've worked with businessesÂ where social media is taken seriously. And with others where it's seen as a nice-to-have for brand positioning but the social media operative isÂ not supported in feeding back their intel into the business where it can beÂ heard at the highest level. ThisÂ means the organisation isÂ not even getting the mostÂ from theirÂ social media person, or team, and channels. I predict that oneÂ day this organisational blindness may prove fatal to the business' future.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, whether your customers are using social media channels like Twitter, they're part of Twitter's reach every day. OurÂ news media channels deliver a constant dietÂ of information gleanedÂ from Twitter - just search the word on <em><a title="The New Zealand Herald's website" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/twitter/search/results.cfm?kw1=twitter&amp;kw2=&amp;st=gsa" target="_blank">The New Zealand Herald</a>'sÂ </em>website, as an example, as see how many results some up. So if you stuff up, it will reach the ears of your consumers, past, present and future.</p>
<p>So yes, if PR doesn't get the social media basics right and advise the businesses they work for accordingly, they and PR are dead in the water.</p>

<p>I am often asked by business owners which social media sites they should use for their small businesses, and whether they should be using social media at all.</p>
<p>My answer is always the same: it depends.</p>
<p>Many businesses believe they can make a decision whether or not to have an online business presence. Those days have been gone for a long time. A search of your business name online will likely reveal that it already exists in many places, and that clients and customers are already engaging with you online even if you are not aware of it.</p>
<p>Determining which sites to use can be overwhelming. Marketing your business through social media should be no different than marketing in any other way â€” it should be targeted to your audience.</p>
<p>Major social sites include: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Vine and Foursquare; and feedback venues like Yelp, Google+ Business, Angieâ€™s List, Yahoo! Local, Yellow Pages and Urbanspoon.</p>
<p>So how do you know which ones are best for your business?</p>
<p>Start by looking at the average age of your target audience and compare it to the average age of the siteâ€™s users. Targeting teens and twenty-somethings? Instagram may be your best bet. Busy professionals on the go? Twitterâ€™s 140-character limit broadcasts bite-sized pieces that are quick and easy to digest. Adult women? Pinterest is influential for that audience.</p>
<p>Is your product or service something that is showcased better in video? Creating a YouTube channel from which to post videos to your website and other social media sites can be advantageous.</p>
<p>Is your product or service something that most people can make a decision regarding? Like clothing or food? Or is your business selling clean rooms to hospitals? The answer to those questions will determine which sites are best for you.</p>
<p>LinkedIn, for example, is better used for business-to-business growth and personal rÃ©sumÃ© connections than Facebook or Pinterest.</p>
<p>Facebook continues to hold the largest number of subscribers with the greatest variety in utility. Users engage with each other and with business pages, games, videos, photos and more. Facebookâ€™s users range in age from teens through adults of all ages. Check-ins on Facebook mimic Foursquareâ€™s check-ins and businesses can be rated on Facebook like they can on Foursquare, Yelp and other sites.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest oversight by many businesses is the failure to claim listings on sites where clients are already engaging, sites like Angieâ€™s List, Yelp, and Google+ Business. By claiming your listing there, you have the ability to shape the customerâ€™s experience. You can upload logos and photos, and complete your listing to include contact information, hours, location and business history. You can also dialogue with members who have commented on your business â€” good and bad.</p>
<p>One of the worst things a business can do is create a social media page and not use it. The key to client engagement is business commitment. So post well, and post often.</p>

<h3>Twitter as #WorldCupÂ publisher</h3>
<p>Twitter outlines how to be part of its own #WorldCup feverÂ <a title="here" href="https://about.twitter.com/what-is-twitter/world-cup" target="_blank">here</a>. Its offering includes changing your profile pic and headerÂ image to the colours and brandingÂ of your preferred team, followÂ real time game action, get behind the scenes with teams and, of course, share and tweet using the #WorldCup hashtag.</p>

<p>Has it worked? Early days yet with the FIFA World Cup not yet a week in action, but a quick snapshot (admittedly during one of the less popular games) in New Zealand the trending hashtag is #WorldCup2014 with #WorldCup not featuring on the leaderboard:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.50.36-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15865" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.50.36-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.50.36 AM" width="285" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>While in Auckland itÂ featuresÂ in third place:</p>

<p>AndÂ worldwide, the #WorldCup hashtag hasn't even made the top 10 (at the time of writing), although the <a title="#USAvsGhana" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAvsGhana" target="_blank">#USAvsGhana</a>Â game takes top billing:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.54.33-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15867" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.54.33-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.54.33 AM" width="285" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>This is the first time I recall seeing <a title="a bespoke page dedicated to a hashtag" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldCup" target="_blank">a bespoke page dedicated to a hashtag</a> and I like it:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.58.32-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15868" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-9.58.32-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 9.58.32 AM" width="1663" height="931" /></a></p>
<p>Being able to click on View Match...</p>

<p>...and launch straight into a global <a title="hashtag feed" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GHAvsUSA" target="_blank">hashtag feed</a> of the game makes great sense:</p>
<p><a href="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-10.08.01-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15871" src="http://aboutus.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-10.08.01-AM.png" alt="Screen shot 2014-06-17 at 10.08.01 AM" width="1663" height="932" /></a></p>
<p>I thinkÂ this move by Twitter isÂ a smartÂ contribution to online publishing via social media. It's great for football fansÂ and lay-viewers alikeÂ on Twitter who are out and about, on public transport, between meetings, or sitting at a desk being able toÂ keep one eye on the score boardÂ andÂ on-the-field action, andÂ the other on their excel spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>So... can you control a hashtag?</h3>
<p>I think the answer is no; no one entity (even Twitter) can control a hashtag - even if they own the channel. I think Twitter has stomped in with a great publishing ideaÂ and has all the tools to back it by creating hashtag feed pages. But ultimatelyÂ people will tweet what they want, and this alters from country to country.</p>
<p>Twitter has however created a compelling reason to join TwitterÂ and a reason to connect with Twitter when the game is on, likelyÂ its mainÂ campaignÂ goals.Â So regardless of success of the #WorldCup hashtag, Twitter gets big tick from me. I also like that despite having what apears to be all theÂ might (and money), Twitter is still not the boss of Twitter - we are!</p>

The three were puzzling over "technology" concernedÂ chiefly aboutÂ being "left behind". In my mother's case, this is not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She has an iPhone and an iPadÂ (which she syncs with iCloud), a Kindle, a laptop and a desktop PC. She actively uses Facebook, Facebook Messenger, YouTube, Skype and Shazm, Googles <em>everything</em> from recipes to directions, downloads information from Wikipedia, reads global news apps on her iPad,Â and uses Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (although less frequently). The others are active users of email and mobile phones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During our conversation, myÂ mother recalled when she was young makingÂ a "toll-call" to New PlymouthÂ from Woodville in the Manawatu meantÂ contacting the exchange and putting in a request, which may or may not have been granted that evening or the next. Today, she marvels that she can send my sister, who is currently in Paris, a messageÂ in Facebook Messenger or send a picture in Snapchat and sheÂ replies immediately. She also is staggered that kids in school today are preparing for careers that do not yet exist (in fact, this is as true of current university students, so fast is the pace of change).</p>
<h3>The point of social media</h3>
<p>What stood out for me in this chat was the emphasis the three placed on the <em>technology</em>Â rather thanÂ the <em>purpose</em> of these tools and channels.Â Our use of technology is fundamentallyÂ about <strong>connecting, communicating, belonging</strong> and in the case of civil revolution, <strong>making change happen</strong>. And none of this is new; these ways of being are historically aboutÂ our survival as humans. Yes, social media isÂ one means of <em>how</em> we achieve connection, communication, belongingÂ and changeÂ but they are not <em>why</em> we do it. And the secret to technological change lies in the why.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Fundamentally, evolution of technology is about making lives better.Â <em style="font-style: italic;">How</em>Â is by connecting, communicating, belonging and making change happen, andÂ <em style="font-style: italic;">What</em>Â is by using tools and channels such as smartphones, tablets and Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Wordpress and more.</span></p>
<p>Yes, the technology is alwaysÂ changing, and we can choose to adapt or not, but ultimatelyÂ <em>it will never pass us by</em>. We will always need to connect with our world, communicate, belong and be part of change, and this will drive our desire to jump on one social media channel or another and get the technology to support it (sooner or later).Â </p>
<h3>Being talked <em>at</em> vs. beingÂ talked <em>with</em></h3>
<p>I then suggested that this evolution of tools and channels is a <em>good</em> thing; thatÂ <span class="Apple-style-span">social media has hailed in an era of human andÂ brand<strong> authenticity</strong></span>. In the case of being human, the longer you're in social media the harder it would be to sustain falsehoods. You cannot lie in LinkedIn for example, because someone in a workplace youÂ professed to work atÂ will call you out.Â </p>
<p>The best bit, is that<strong> every voice inÂ social media is equal</strong>. AÂ brand can't just advertise and tell us that it has great products and services; they mustÂ deliver. If there is a mis-match in a brand's claims, people using social media will share their experienceÂ of usingÂ aÂ product or service: good, bad or ugly. Similarly, in New Zealand, we have the possibility ofÂ direct contact with our politicians, which is unprecedented since lining up to have an audience with a King or Queen. As MP Jacinda Ardern told an Auckland audience this May, tweets come directly to her phone as would a text and she reads every one, adding that it's "impossible" to ignore the collective sentiment within them, though nor would she want to.</p>
<p>So to those afraid of upgrading their "technology" or of using social media - particularly if you're inÂ business - please don't be. These are merely the accessories and extensions of your human experience and ultimately exist because someone wanted to make your life better.</p>

<p>More Australian businesses are advertising their products online and through social media, but smaller companies are reportedly lagging behind.</p>
<p>The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows almost half of businesses have a website or web presence, and just over one quarter are active on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>But larger companies are outperforming smaller ones in both areas.</p>
<p>In June last year, 98 per cent of businesses with 200 or more staff had an online presence, and two thirds were active on social media.</p>
<p>Although small businesses are starting to move online, many say the time commitments can be onerous.</p>
<p>Canberra artist Deborah Anne is part of a growing trend of home-based businesses using social media as a voice to generate sales.</p>
<p>Initially she started selling her three-dimensional paper pictures at the markets, through craft website Etsy and on Facebook.</p>
<p>But she is currently building her own website to attract more sales.</p>
<p>"I think people expect it, though not everybody is on Facebook and that's why I need to get the website up and running as well," Ms Anne said.</p>
<p>"I can put photos up there so people have a visual thing to see what I'm all about. I've had contact from people all around Australia and even internationally."</p>
<p>It is an experience shared by hobby horse maker Michael Holmes who is based in the southern New South Wales village of Bungendore.</p>
<p>He has a large online presence, with profiles on Twitter, Facebook, Etsy and Instagram and an individual business website.</p>
<p>"We get a lot of people enquire online and through Facebook and then come to see us at the markets, to see what the product is like before they actually buy it, especially the large rocking horses," Mr Holmes said.</p>
<p>"The traffic varies. Obviously the month before Christmas is really busy with orders but generally all through the year we might get enquires up to 10 o'clock at night."</p>
<p>Mr Holmes recently joined an art co-op which wants to open a retail store in Canberra later this year, but said the online contact would remain an important part of his business model.</p>
<p>"People like that. Everyone asks us if we are local," he said.</p>
<p>"And I find people like to buy from local people, not from big companies, especially when the product is handmade."</p>
<p>Nationally the proportion of companies with a web presence is slowly rising, and social media activity has jumped from 18 per cent of companies to 26 per cent in the 12 months to June 2013.</p>
<p>The increased online activity is matched with more sales for Australian businesses.</p>
<p>Internet orders during 2012-2013 were worth close to $250 billion, an increase of almost $10 billion from the previous year.</p>
